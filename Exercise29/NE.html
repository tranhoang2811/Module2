        Doc-Centric Sales: Northeast Region
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Northeast region had a mixed sales year last year. Some models like the C300-25 performed admirably, while
        others like the C200-20 had disappointing years. We anticipate a stronger year in current year with the
        introduction of the C300-30 model - a great copier at a competitive price.
