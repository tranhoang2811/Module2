        Doc-Centric Sales: Midwest Region
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Midwest region had another strong sales year with record-setting sales of both the M300-25 and M100-11
        models. The only disappointment was the lackluster sales of the M300-15 model, which started the year strong but
        tapered off into the fourth quarter. All-in-all though, a very good year for the Midwest region.
