        Doc-Centric Sales: South Region
    </h1>
    <p>
        Sales in the Southern region were off last year as the economy entered a slight downturn. Sales of the M100-10
        model suffered the largest decline - 15% under sales two years ago. The lone bright spot was the continuing
        strong sales of the M300-25 unit which increased as last year progressed.
