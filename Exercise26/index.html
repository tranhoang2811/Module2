                            Welcome to the Dunston Retreat Center. Whether you are planning to attend one of our many
                            conferences or embarking on a private retreat, we're sure that you will enjoy your stay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Located in the northern woods of Wisconsin, the Dunston Retreat Center provides comfortable and
                            attractive accommodations while you enjoy the rustic setting available just outside your door.
                            The Retreat Center has 32 beds, large meeting rooms, a chapel, and kitchen facilities. If you
                            want to get out, there are ample opportunities for hiking, canoeing and horseback riding in the
                            surrounding area.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout the year the center staff conducts retreats to accommodate the needs of various
                            groups. We offer retreats for men, for women, and for couples. Please call about special needs
                            retreats.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you prefer, an individually directed retreat is possible. The retreat includes a time of
                            daily sharing and guidance by a retreat director to supplement your private time of solitude and
                            meditation.

                            A letter from one of our guests
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            I'm writing to tell you how much I enjoyed my retreat at Dunston. I came to your center haggard
                            and worn out from a long illness and job difficulties. I left totally refreshed. I especially
                            want to thank Father Thomas Holloway for his support.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've enthusiastically told all of my friends about the wonderful place you have. Some of us are
                            hoping to organize a group retreat. Rest assured that you'll see me again. Going to Dunston will
                            become a yearly event for me.
                        </p>

                            Sincerely,
